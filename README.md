scraping https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/ for ship details. what annoying is that only have first 200 pages in html. don't know whether it's bcos I don't have a PREMIUM account or just the programmer thought not one would looking those message page by page, so he just to laze.(fair enough, cos normal guys would just use the search function provided on the top of the page, it's impossible to find message u want by looking at info on page, there are too many)
